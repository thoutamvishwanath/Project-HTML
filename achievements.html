    <h1>Welcome to my achievements!</h1>
    <h3>My first achievement is getting third rank in 5th class first FA exam in Shivani High School.
        I used to be very much dull in studies when I am studying in Saketha.But I suddenly got allot of interest,
        encouragement and appreciation in Shivani. I also earned a good name in extra-cirrucular activities like speeches,
        debates, quiz competitions, essay writings etc. When I was studying 7th standard, I had a record of telling total
        118 elements of Modern Periodic table within 53 seconds.My principal presented me a gift and my name became very
        popular throughout the school.I scored first rank in all the exams of 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th standard continuously.
        By observing all my achievements, talent and confidence, my school elected me as "School People Leader" when I was 
        studying 10th standard.And in intermediate, I achieved a good rank of 4482 in TG EAPCET examination.
