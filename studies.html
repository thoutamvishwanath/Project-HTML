    Welcome to my studies!
    </h1>
    <h3>
        I studied Nursery to 4th standard, in Saketha High School and 5th to 10th standard in Shivani High School, Bheemaram,
        Hanamkonda.The reason behind changing of my school is no proper IIT Foundation at that time.I got 10 GPA in Shivani
        High School.And then I moved to Hyderabad and did my intermediate in Narayana Junior College,Madhapur.I got 951 marks
        in IPE, 91 percentile in JEE Mains and 4482 rank in TG EAPCET.Now, I am currently pursuing Bachelor of Engineering
